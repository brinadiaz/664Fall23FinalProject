It was so delicious. There was so much variety on the menu. The service was great, very attentive and friendly staff. The only downside, from my experience, was the music was a bit loud so it was difficult to have a conversation. Besides that, the food was great. Definitely a family friendly restaurant."

Portions are big. We ordered 2 entrees for 2 people. We can't finish it. They have a bar, and seating are plenty. From the outside, we thought it's going to be a small restaurant with 15seats but when you go to the side of the resto, they have many more seats. Food was delicious."

We visited Rosa Mexicano and I can honestly say it was the most wonderful experience. The service and quality of food was exemplary. It is a bit of a long way to come back, but I most definitely will, the next time I am visiting. I also adored the frozen margaritas. Thank you for such a memorable time."

I saw the sign for Rosa,decided to try it. Was in the mood for a hamburger  the price was reasonable
WOW so happy I did. Greeted warmly,seated in a quiet spot. Terrific server,brought out sala,chips,immediately.
That hamburger I was in the mood for was delicious. Great dressing,just the right amount of heat. The Cucumber mint mocktail was very excellent. I will absolutely come back here."

Rosa Mexicano,"9 East 18th Street, New York, NY 10003, USA","9 east 18th street, manhattan, ny 10003",Stephanie Yoon,4,5 months ago,"Good food, fun atmosphere, friendly service. My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday, and the host graciously let us move over to a booth once one opened up even after we were seated.

We ordered a pomegranate margarita, regular margarita, Italian Coke, and a sparkling water. Margaritas were strong and not too sweet, just the way I like it. We ordered the guacamole for an appetizer, which never disappoints.  For food, we ordered the enchiladas, fish tacos, and -I know this is going to sound like sacrilege- the cheeseburger with fries.  Everything was delicious.

This place has been one of our go-to restaurants for brunch, lunch and dinner for almost a decade.  Even though it seems to have changed in quality and style under new management, we still enjoyed ourselves.

Pro-tip: the tacos do not come with a side, so I would recommend ordering either rice or some veggies to complement any taco dishes.

All in all, I recommend coming to this casual and fun Mexican restaurant for celebratory events or a casual meal with friends.  Enjoy!"

Travelled all around the country and the entire menu is absolutely delicious and best I have had. Quality meat, ingredients, and toppings- you will taste the difference! I go out of my way to eat here when I‚Äôm in New York. You won‚Äôt be disappointed- unless you didn‚Äôt order enough the first time.
The wait times vary but it is just that, waiting in line. Once you make your purchase you get your food right away made right in front of you."

I had a beef and a marinated pork taco and they were yummy! It can get a little messy eating but it was worth it.

They take orders pretty quickly and serve up fast too. You just stand there and eat or take away. The chips with guacamole is good too. You can see and eat chunks of avocado."

Went there on a weekday afternoon, with a little que but the order taking is fast. Collect your order ticket and hand over to the chef for preparation. You get to choose flour or corn taco,and the condiments. After collecting your food, toppings are available at the side. Tried their grilled steak and chicken tacos, flavorful and delicious. Will come back to try others for sure. There is plenty of standing area to enjoy your tacos in house."

I don‚Äôt get what the hype is about. I had a lot better in Chicago for less money (at a family owned place). This place become a mass-production chain and that might be the reason?

While I did enjoy the food, I didn‚Äôt find it to be exceptional in any way. Staff were super friendly and efficient, it was cool to see them work.

Would I eat there again? Sure. But I would go of my path to get there."

Super cool vibe. Very attentive service. Missed happy hour so go before 7pm. But we did get the Taco üåÆ Tuesday special & the tacos were fantastic. Enjoyed the chicken more than the carnitas. Sadly chips & salsa are not complimentary but ordering the guacamole was a good choice - delicious and a huge serving we couldn‚Äôt even finish.  Check out the rooftop bar too. Again, great vibe up there but limited views. Recommend!!"

Nothing really noteworthy to report here. Well ok, their chips and salsa are decent. Their salads are ok with typical serving size. The atmosphere is geared more towards the young crowd, seems like a fun place if you were in your 20s and just want to have ok food with ok drinks with reasonable prices in NYC. You're here to have fun, not to have a gastronomical experience."

Loose hair over the table taking our order, shuffling several papers while writing and, yes, of course! our order came all wrong, mixed and with things and ingredients we specially ask 3 times NOT put in the dish.

Some of their menu items can be on the pricey end but nonetheless the food is delicious.

The decor is tasteful and accompanied with Latin/Hispanic music while you enjoy your meal and drink(s).

The waitress wasn‚Äôt as attentive and we couldn‚Äôt find her when we wanted more water or our bill. The food and beverage was pretty good. We hope to return to receive better service.

A community staple indeed. Establishment is rather large and can accommodate large parties of 6+"
Tacuba Cantina Mexicana,"35-01 36th Street, Queens, NY 11106, USA","35-01 36th street, queens, ny 11106, usa",Eduardo Martinez,5,3 months ago,"From the moment we walked into Tacuba, we knew we were in for a treat. The vibrant ambiance set the tone for an unforgettable dining experience. Our evening started with refreshing cocktails - the Paloma was a delightful burst of citrus, the Mojito was perfectly minty, and the Mezcal Pi√±a Margarita had a smoky depth that was unparalleled.

For appetizers, we ventured into the Aguachile ($20) that was a symphony of flavors and freshness, the Elotes ($9) were grilled to perfection, the Nachos with Steak were a mountain of goodness, and the Queso Fundido with Chorizo was a molten pot of savory delight.

Our mains were equally impressive. The Pulpo and Chorizo Tacos brought the ocean and land together in a mouthwatering combo, while the Chicken Fajitas were sizzling and packed with flavor. The Green Chicken Enchiladas were a comforting dish, wrapped in a beautifully tangy sauce.

We ended our meal with the Flan - a creamy, caramel-rich conclusion to a fantastic meal. Everything we tasted was delicious and left a lasting impression. Highly recommend Tacuba for anyone seeking an authentic and exquisite Mexican culinary journey!"

Not only was the food fresh and tasty. Pretty authentic in my experience. (Not overly salted, but plenty of subtle flavors in the guac trio and tacos -- which my girl friend and I shared). The vegetarian tacos were the best in my opinion. The brisket tacos were too fatty for my taste, but if you like that, you'll enjoy.
The restaurant itself was nicely decorated -- loved the walls & art, and the layout is tight, but cozy. It was absolutely perfect for our catch-up girl date! (Very small restroom, with tiny changing table, not sure if there was another restroom upstairs.)
The margaritas are super! Complexity of salt & sweet and mildly spicy.
The most surprising positive was the service, they were attentive, but once they heard this was a ""catch-up"" brunch, the waitress was so careful to ""look over"", but not interrupt. However, once when we were trying to get her attention, but she was occupied, the hostess made sure we had what we needed.
Excellent, absolutely recommend!"

Best carne asada tacos ever, very tender and flavorful. Enjoyed the tres guacamoles as a family had something for everyone. The margarita was well made, however I recommend you get the mezcalitas instead for a more unique experience. Don't normally recommend cod but the bacalao trufado mushrooms were very nicely paired with the mezcalitas de pi√±a."

MEXiCUE,"1440 Broadway, New York, NY 10018, USA","1440 broadway, manhattan, ny 10018",Leslie Esquivel,5,3 weeks ago,"We came here randomly while in NYC. We arrived around 5:00pm and didn‚Äôt have a reservation but we‚Äôre able to be seated at either the window bar table or a high top. We chose the high top table. If you choose this option just note the tables are super small, the chairs have no back support and there are no hooks to hang purses or coats. This was the main reason I gave the ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù 4 stars. I had to eat with my purse on my shoulder and hat and coat in my lap.

It was still happy hour and we were super happy to see that the house margarita (pictured) was discounted. It was a very well balanced margarita. Not too sweet or sour.

I ordered the wild mushroom quesadilla and lorrrrrd have mercy they were delightful!! It was hands down THE BEST vegetarian dish I‚Äôve ever had. We will deff be back next time we are in the city and craving a wonderful margarita and Mexican food."

My water glass was always full, my food came out quickly, and he checked in at just the right times. With my family we decided to ask for a table side guacamole to start and for the main course our server convinced us to ask for the combos of four , we highly recommend choose the steak taco and the tamales. Luigis friendly personality also enhanced the dining experience

By the end of the meal, I was thoroughly impressed by the top-notch service. The food was delicious, but Luigi‚Äôs  attentiveness and charm made the night extra special.

Very loud at peak hours but a cool vibe.  Server kept us waiting and we had to ask others for water refills and for the bill.

Recommend getting the suadero and lengua tacos if you‚Äôre feeling a little adventurous. Otherwise the classic chicken, steak or chorizo tacos are my go-tos.

Have been coming here for years and never disappoints.

One note - there are no reservations and can be a bit of a wait if you get there during prime time (especially during an LA sports game because they play it on the TV), so my rec is to just get there a little on the early side."

The meat was overcooked and didn't have the flavor of the broth, extremely bland. I ordered a side of beans and flautas which were technically taquito, all were bland almost as if they were frozen not fresh, the beans were too runny and had no texture. My BF got some form of a Burrito, but not, they called it a ""burritas"" basically a rolled tortilla with hamburger meat inside. He liked it but wasn't filling so he ordered some fish tacos that were much better in his opinion. Their quac was good, and so was their salsa. Cocktails were also very good.

I came back to the city, excited to come back to the location. The wait staff was very nice and accommodating. They have tables outdoors and indoors, so the waitstaff is busy going back and forth.
Food was good. Though there was no pico de Galo, very little jalape√±o and a small amount of guacamole, no sour cream, and pre shredded cojita cheese (that‚Äôs odd for a ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô Mexican spot), I enjoyed the nachos. The tacos were also nice.
The drinks?
My husband and I both got drinks- he got a piba colada and I got a passion fruit frozen margarita
My guy they tasted like water was the primary flavor. It was trash. I‚Äôve never had such a flavorless margarita in my life. My husband couldn‚Äôt even really drink his pi√±a colada.
So if you want good food, come here. If you want alcohol, stick with the beer. I guess COVID affected this spot hard cause it‚Äôs just not the same.
